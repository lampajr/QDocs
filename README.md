# QDocs
Android mobile application presented during the course 'Design and implementation of mobile application'  at Politecnico di Milano, academic year 2018/2019

## Scope
The QDocs app is a file-storage mobile application which help users to organize, visualize and, above all, find in a faster way their personal stored files. In
fact, there are many files that users use rarely and after some time they no longer remember where they were placed. QDocs allows user to basically associate a stored
file to a specific and unique QR-code that can be printed and placed in a site of the “real world” that is related to that file. When the QR-code is scanned, the related
file is instantly shown on the smartphone.

More information about technical components can be found in the [technical document]("https://github.com/lampajr/QDocs/blob/master/documentation/SDD___QDocs.pdf")

## examples
* A student takes notes on his notebook and he wants to extend his notes with some digital articles or some digital book pages. He can upload the articles on his QDocs storage and print the generated QR-code on the personal notebook.
2When he must study and want to read the articles, he can easily scan the QR-code with the application scanner and immediately the file appears on the
smartphone.

* Since nowadays more and more electronic tools are sold with digital instruction booklet, QDocs can become very useful for keeping associate the tool with its
instruction booklet. A simple example can be the following, suppose to buy a camera and suppose that after long time you don’t remember what the
functionality of a specific button is, very often you don’t remember where the booklet was stored. So to overcome this problem you can store the instruction
booklet on the QDocs storage and print its QR-code on the camera and then whenever you have to access this document you can easily scan its QR-code (that you know is placed on the camera) and instantly read the document.
